PopAndStack is a fast, cozy merge game with a twist: gravity shifts every few seconds. Drop pastel balls, merge matching colors, and chain combos for huge scores. When gravity flips, the danger line moves, so every drop matters.

- One tap controls
- Gravity phases (down, left, up, right)
- Combo scoring and satisfying merges
- Short, replayable runs

Play to climb the scoreboard, collect perfect merges, and master the shifts.
